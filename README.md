# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn, helping businesses identify customers likely to leave and take proactive retention measures. The model uses historical customer data and machine learning algorithms to classify churn behavior.

## Dataset
- **Features**: Customer demographics, subscription details, service usage, and payment information.
- **Target**: Churn status (0 = Retained, 1 = Churned).

## Objectives
1. Analyze and preprocess customer data.
2. Train machine learning models to predict churn.
3. Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Technologies
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Implementation
1. Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical features).
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key churn factors.
3. Train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
4. Evaluate models with metrics and optimize hyperparameters.

## Results
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting with 92% accuracy.
- High precision and recall for identifying churned customers.

## Usage
Run the model on new data to predict churn and derive insights for retention strategies.
